<!-- Responsive web design is about creating web pages that look good on all devices!
A responsive web design will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and viewports. -->
<!-- What is Responsive Web Design?
Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones) -->
<!-- Setting The Viewport
To create a responsive website, add the following <meta> tag to all your web pages:<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
This will set the viewport of your page, which will give the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.-->
<!-- Responsive Images
Responsive images are images that scale nicely to fit any browser size.
Using the width Property
If the CSS width property is set to 100%, the image will be responsive and scale up and down -->
<!-- the image can be scaled up to be larger than its original size. A better solution, in many cases, will be to use the max-width property instead.
Using the max-width Property
If the max-width property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size -->
<!-- Show Different Images Depending on Browser Width
The HTML <picture> element allows you to define different images for different browser window sizes. -->
<!-- Responsive Text Size
The text size can be set with a "vw" unit, which means the "viewport width". -->
<!-- Viewport is the browser window size. 1vw = 1% of viewport width. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw is 0.5cm. -->
<!-- Media Queries
In addition to resize text and images, it is also common to use media queries in responsive web pages.
With media queries you can define completely different styles for different browser sizes.
Example: resize the browser window to see that the three div elements below will display horizontally on large screens and stack vertically on small screens -->
