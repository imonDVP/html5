<!-- The HTML id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element.
You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document. -->
<!-- Using The id Attribute
The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.
The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id. -->
<!-- The syntax for id is:
write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}. -->
<!-- Note: The id name is case sensitive!
Note: The id name must contain at least one character, cannot start with a number, and must not contain whitespaces (spaces, tabs, etc.). -->
<!-- Difference Between Class and ID:
A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page -->
