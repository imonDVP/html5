<!-- HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. -->
<!-- HSLA color values are an extension of HSL with an Alpha channel (opacity). -->
<!-- In HTML, a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form:hsl(hue, saturation, lightness) -->
<!-- Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue. -->
<!-- Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color. -->
<!-- Lightness is also a percentage value. 0% is black, and 100% is white. -->
<!-- Experiment by mixing the HSL values below:hsl(0, 100%, 50%) -->
<!-- Saturation can be described as the intensity of a color. -->
<!-- 100% is pure color, no shades of gray. -->
<!-- 50% is 50% gray, but you can still see the color. -->
<!-- 0% is completely gray; you can no longer see the color. -->
<!-- The lightness of a color can be described as how much light you want to give the color, where 0% means no light (black), 50% means 50% light (neither dark nor light), and 100% means full lightness (white). -->
<!-- HSLA color values are an extension of HSL color values, with an Alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color. -->
<!-- An HSLA color value is specified with:hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha) -->
<!-- The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all): -->
<!-- Experiment by mixing the HSLA values below:hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5) -->
