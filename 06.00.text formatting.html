<!-- HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning. -->
<!-- Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:
   <b> - Bold text
   <strong> - Important text
   <i> - Italic text
   <em> - Emphasized text
   <mark> - Marked text
    <small> - Smaller text
    <del> - Deleted text
   <ins> - Inserted text
    <sub> - Subscript text
    <sup> - Superscript text -->
<!-- The HTML <b> element defines bold text, without any extra importance. -->
<!-- The HTML <strong> element defines text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold. -->
<!-- The HTML <i> element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.
Tip: The <i> tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc. -->
<!-- The HTML <em> element defines emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.
Tip: A screen reader will pronounce the words in <em> with an emphasis, using verbal stress. -->
<!-- The HTML <small> element defines smaller text: -->
<!-- The HTML <mark> element defines text that should be marked or highlighted: -->
<!-- The HTML <del> element defines text that has been deleted from a document. Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text: -->
<!-- The HTML <ins> element defines a text that has been inserted into a document. Browsers will usually underline inserted text -->

<!-- The HTML <sup> element defines superscript text. Superscript text appears half a character above the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Superscript text can be used for footnotes, like WWW[1] -->
